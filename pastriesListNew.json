In the 1950s and the 1960s, the popularity of these treats was so big that new doughnut chains started appearing on the market, such as Krispy Kreme and Dunkin' Donuts, helping in the perception of doughnuts as breakfast food.",

The perception that apple pie was solely American was fueled by soldiers in World War II, who told everyone that they were fighting battles for mom and apple pie, the magazine explains.\n\nBut was apple pie really an American dessert? The first pies in the United States came to the country with the early settlers, and those were savory British concoctions filled with meat and spices. And as Smithsonian pointed out, the oldest-known apple pie recipe comes from 14th-century England, too.

But whether you lightly turn and brown the sweet meringue or catch it on fire, it tastes wonderful with its chocolate and graham cracker sandwich.",

The original recipe is delicious on it’s own, but I really love how many amazingly delicious variations there are to think up!  I’ve made lots of yummy and fun Rice Krispie Treat variations before, but this chocolate, caramel and peanut butter version is going to be added to my list of favorites!\n\nIf you’re curious about the name, these Whatchamacallit Krispie Treats were inspired by the Whatchamacallit candy bar.  A Whatchamacallit candy bar is a “peanut flavored crisp with a layer of caramel, and covered in milk chocolate.”  These Whatchamacallit Krispie Treats have all the same flavors and textures of the delicious candy bar…. and you can make them at home anytime you want!   In fact, I like this Krispie Treat version even better than the candy bar!",

The Adams Extract Company and the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York both claim to have invented the cake. Regardless, red velvet cake rose in prominence during the mid-1900s in the United States. Using cocoa in the cake seemed to soften the product, which gave rise to the term velvet. The cake itself is airy and smooth, with the cocoa adding to the batter without overpowering it. It's topped with buttery and rich cream cheese icing. The addition of the red food color makes sense from Adams Extract, at least: Popular red cakes would sell more red food coloring. Without the red dye, the cake is a lighter shade of chocolate and just as tasty, though it might just be termed velvet.",

Nowadays, the crackers are used in the preparation of s'mores, while graham cracker crumbs are used for pies, cheesecakes, and moon pies.
