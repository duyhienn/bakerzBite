Those early doughnuts were often made with prunes, raisins, or apples in the middle. During World War I, the doughnut was already an American favorite, consumed by soldiers that were fighting overseas as a reminder of home. In the 1950s and the 1960s, the popularity of these treats was so big that new doughnut chains started appearing on the market, such as Krispy Kreme and Dunkin' Donuts, helping in the perception of doughnuts as breakfast food.",

But was apple pie really an American dessert? The first pies in the United States came to the country with the early settlers, and those were savory British concoctions filled with meat and spices. And as Smithsonian pointed out, the oldest-known apple pie recipe comes from 14th-century England, too.

A married couple of Ohio football fans, Gail and Steve Lucas, received a gift of some chocolate-covered peanut butter balls for Christmas. Gail recreated the recipe, but she didn't cover the peanut butter entirely. The visible portion of peanut butter looked like the nut from a buckeye tree.

It's topped with buttery and rich cream cheese icing. The addition of the red food color makes sense from Adams Extract, at least: Popular red cakes would sell more red food coloring.

            "description": "Graham cracker is a sweet American cracker made with graham flour and usually flavored with honey or cinnamon. The crackers date back to the early 1880s, when they were made with graham flour, lard or shortening, salt, molasses, and oil. They were invented by Sylvester Graham, a Presbyterian minister who introduced them in hopes to end masturbation – he believed that a radical vegetarian diet without white flour and spices would end lustful behaviour. Nowadays, the crackers are used in the preparation of s'mores, while graham cracker crumbs are used for pies, cheesecakes, and moon pies. In the Philippines, an icebox cake known as mango float uses graham crackers, cream, and mangoes.",

            "description": "Snickerdoodles are classic old-fashioned cookies that are rolled in a mixture of cinnamon and white sugar, consisting of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. They are characterized by their texture (soft or crispy), a cracked surface of the exterior, and a buttery, sweet flavor. The cookies got their name from the German word Schneckennudeln, meaning cinnamon-dusted sweet rolls, and another theory suggest that the name stems from a series of tales from the 1900s that centered around a hero named Snickerdoodle.

            "description": "Usually accompanied by a glass of milk or a cup of hot tea or coffee, chocolate chip cookies are well balanced between salty and sweet in flavor, tenderly chewy in texture, and filled with small melting chocolate pyramids, bringing a generation of Americans back to their childhood. The origin story of these sweet treats is incredibly interesting, almost as the cookies themselves. The Toll House Inn was a popular bed-and-breakfast in Whitman, Massachusetts, bought by Ruth Graves Wakefield and her husband in 1930. Ruth's cooking was so good that the inn gained an excellent reputation in a short span of time. ",
